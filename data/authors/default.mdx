I've been programming since I was 14. I joined a programming club in high school and started solving programming challenges using Pascal and later C++. This led me to participate once in the [International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)](https://ioinformatics.org/) [[Bronze Medal](https://stats.ioinformatics.org/search?q=Alejandro+Reyes&yf=2009&ys=2009)], and twice in the [ACM-ICPC World Finals](https://icpc.global/) [[Honorable Mention](https://icpc.global/ICPCID/G5QG9UL9MV2P)]

I studied Computer Science. During this time in college, I also did Freelance work using C#, ASP.NET, and Microsoft SQL Server. Then some mobile development using Xamarin and Swift.

After graduating I started focusing on the [React](https://react.dev/) stack. I incorporated [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) shortly after and have used them continuously since then.

I spend most of my time writing Frontend code using React and TypeScript. I like to set up the best Developer Experience possible, combining VSCode, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Lint Staged, Conventional Commits, Semantic Versioning, etc. I used to create custom builds using Webpack and Babel before Vite and NextJS. I use Storybook, Jest, and Cypress for testing. I prefer when machines do the work so I automate with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, and Travis CI.

When not writing code, I [read](/favorite-readings), hike, travel, work out, and explore new food places. I can eat Mexican every day ðŸŒ®
