summary: In many scenarios string literals + unions are a better way to define a set of values.
---

Enums are available in both Flow and TypeScript. Codebases may also use other tools such as [keymirror](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keymirror).

Issues with keymirror:

- More verbose than using string literals.
- No type definitions (unless you also install its types package).

In both type systems, using enums has several [drawbacks](https://flow.org/en/docs/enums/using-enums/#toc-when-to-not-use-enums).

One common use case for enums is to define a set of values that can be used in an API surface. Think of variants in a button component or the possible event types.

Consider an enum for a log level:

1. Enum
  ```ts
  enum LogLevel {
    INFO = "INFO",
    WARNING = "WARNING",
    ERROR = "ERROR",
  }
  ```

Some other alternatives are:

2. keyMirror
  ```ts
  const LogLevel = keyMirror({
    INFO: null,
    WARNING: null,
    ERROR: null,
  });
  ```
3. Regular object
  ```ts
  const LogLevel = Object.freeze({
    INFO: "INFO",
    WARNING: "WARNING",
    ERROR: "ERROR",
  });
  ```
  > `Object.freeze` is used to get a const type back (ie: we get `INFO` instead of `string`).
4. String literals + unions
  ```ts
  type LogLevel = "INFO" | "WARNING" | "ERROR";
  ```

Things that options 1, 2, and 3 have in common:
- The `LogLevel` symbol must be in scope to be used.
- It won't automatically give you a type for the possible values. When the property is typed as a string we are missing an opportunity to use the type system to catch bugs.
- Options 1 and 3 are prone to mismatches between keys and values.

```ts
import { LogLevel } from "./...";

// ❌ weak typing
const log = (logLevel: string) => ...

// somewhere else
log(LogLevel.INFO);
log('foo');
```

In order to improve this we would have to define a type for the possible values:

```ts
type LogLevelT = (typeof LogLevel)[keyof typeof LogLevel];
```

and use it everywhere:

```ts
import { LogLevel, LogLevelT } from "./...";

// ✅ correct typing
const log = (logLevel: LogLevelT) => ...

// now this is redundant because TypeScript won't let you pass anything else
log(LogLevel.INFO);

// now this will fail
log('foo');
```

But why do all those extra steps when we can just use string literals + unions? By using option 4 we get the following benefits:
- The `LogLevel` type is only needed when typing the property but it does not have to be in scope on the call site.
- We define the set of possible values only once in a single type (there is only one symbol to keep in mind).
- It's less likely that the property will be typed as `string` because there is a type for it.
- Autocomplete works as expected.

One additional benefit of using string literals + unions is that it's easier to iterate over the possible values. When needed we can express the set of values like so:

```ts
const LogLevels = [
    "INFO",
    "WARNING",
    "ERROR",
] as const;
type LogLevel = typeof LogLevels[number];
```

This prevents us from having to use `Object.keys` or `Object.values` which are prone to errors.
