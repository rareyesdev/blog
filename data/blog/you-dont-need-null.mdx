summary: Having two non-values in JavaScript is now considered a design mistake. You are better off using undefined when possible.

## TLDR;

> You don't need `null`. Use `undefined` instead.

- Having two non-values in JavaScript is now considered a design mistake (even by JavaScript's creator, Brendan Eich and [Douglas Crockford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSGEjv3Tqo0&feature=youtu.be&t=9m21s)).
- The creator of null pointers Tony Hoare is known for calling his own creation a "billion-dollar mistake". **One nullish value is bad enough.**
- You get smaller API payloads and less code overall.
- It will dramatically reduce the amount and complexity of presence checks in the code.

## Counter arguments

### What if I want to define a nullish value intentionally?

In that case, just assign undefined to it:

```typescript
const anObject = {
    ...otherObject,
    propertyToNullify: undefined,
};
```

### But what about the semantic differences?

Folks that use it a lot (generally coming from other languages that have null as the only nullish value) get pretty mad about such claims. The most common response I get is:

> null is for intentional missing values, and undefined should be used when the values were never set in the first place.

The first thing I think with responses like that is: Why would you ever need to make that distinction? Both are nullish, and you don't need to differentiate between "intentionally missing" and "unintentionally missing".

```typescript
const people = [
    {
        firstName: "Bernard",
        middleName: null,
        lastName: "Roy",
    },
    {
        firstName: "Donald",
        middleName: "Ervin",
        lastName: "Knuth",
    },
];
```

But you can just omit `middleName` when the user doesn't have one:

```typescript
const people = [
    {
        firstName: "Bernard",
        lastName: "Roy",
    },
    // ...
];
```

Or, you can set `middleName` to an empty string if the user intentionally left that blank and you need to know that:

```typescript
const people = [
    {
        firstName: "Luke",
        middleName: "",
        lastName: "Shiru",
    },
    // ...
];
```

The TypeScript representation would be something like this:

```typescript
type Person = {
    firstName: string;
    middleName?: string;
    lastName: string;
};
```

### But document.querySelector('wrong-selector') returns null

Yes, it does, and it's a pain, but you can easily type it like this instead:

```javascript
const element = document.querySelector('wrong-selector') ?? undefined;
```

This prevents `null` from leaking into the rest of the codebase.

### But the API is returning null

- Use an API wrapper. Instead of spreading null all over your codebase, update your surface of contact with the API so nulls are removed.
- If you have any contact with the folks making the API, propose making API responses smaller by getting rid of null values. You should try to avoid ending up [over-engineering/over-complicating your app](https://dev.to/sargalias/nulls-and-null-checks-how-to-work-safely-with-nulls-in-any-codebase-1oeh) just to deal with null when you can just avoid it altogether.

The **nullish coalescing operator** `??` can be used to convert from null to undefined anywhere a null value is received from an external API.

### But in JSON, at least, I can use null?

In JSON structures undefined cannot be used as that type does not exist. You can hover assign null to a property `{"someProperty": null}`, but why would you do that? If the property `someProperty` has no value, it's better to just exclude that property completely. Keeping such properties just increases the payload size that needs to be sent over the network or stored in a file without actually giving you any extra benefits. If you are thinking that having the explicit property makes it easier to discover, that's what types and schemas are for.

## Action items

### Don't compare to null

If your code base interacts with other APIs that might give you a null then use an `==` check instead of `===`. `value == undefined` will be true for `null` and `undefined` but not for other falsy values (`''`, `false`, `0`).

```javascript
/// Imaging you are doing `value == undefined` where value can be one of:
console.log(undefined == undefined); // true
console.log(null == undefined); // true
console.log(0 == undefined); // false
console.log('' == undefined); // false
console.log(false == undefined); // false
```

### <a id="ai-2" /> Don’t initialize optional sub-properties

Just don't set it. Your type annotation should have it as optional anyway. Don’t set it to `null` or `undefined`. Just have it as absent:

```typescript
interface Foo {
 a: number;
 b?: number;
}

// Don't set `b` to anything.
const foo: Foo = {
  a: 123
};
```

### Arrays (type and value) should never be left uninitialized

Setting any array to undefined will trigger presence checks down the line. Initialize all arrays to empty instead.

### Okay okay, this might make sense, how can I force all my colleagues into submission?

That is not a nice thought, anyhow, ask them nicely and then add the [eslint-plugin-no-null](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-no-null) plugin to your .eslintrc:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "no-null"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "no-null/no-null": 2
  }
}
```

## <a id="exceptions" /> Exceptions

Never use null, unless the ecosystem dictates it. e.g. node style callbacks expect the error argument to be set to null in case of no error. Even then I (and pretty much everyone else) do a truthy check on null and not an explicit one.

```javascript
fs.readFile('someFile', 'utf8', (err,data) => {
  if (err) {
    // do something
  }
  // no error
});
```
